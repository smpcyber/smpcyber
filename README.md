<h2>[Cybersecurity Labs]</h2>
The goal of these labs is to teach myself how to emulate, attack, and fortify corporate networks for a future career in cybersecurity.  The format of these labs are written step-by-step in a way that I would have liked to have been taught.  I'm sure there are more concise and detailed guides to building labs, but this is for me.  If the format of these labs happen to help other prospective blue or red teamers who are prone to learn in a similar manner as I do, then that would be a happy coincidence.
